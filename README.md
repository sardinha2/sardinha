## :tangerine: Usage examples

###### Query for a single target

```bash
$ h8mail -t target@example.com
```

###### Query for list of targets, indicate config file for API keys, output to `pwned_targets.csv`
```bash
$ h8mail -t targets.txt -c config.ini -o pwned_targets.csv
```

###### Query a list of targets against local copy of the Breach Compilation, pass API key for [Snusbase](https://snusbase.com/) from the command line
```bash
$ h8mail -t targets.txt -bc ../Downloads/BreachCompilation/ -k "snusbase_token=$snusbase_token"
```

###### Query without making API calls against local copy of the Breach Compilation
```bash
$ h8mail -t targets.txt -bc ../Downloads/BreachCompilation/ -sk
```

###### Search every .gz file for targets found in targets.txt locally, skip default checks

```bash
$ h8mail -t targets.txt -gz /tmp/Collection1/ -sk
```

###### Check a cleartext dump for target. Add the next 10 related emails to targets to check. Read keys from CLI

```bash
$ h8mail -t admin@evilcorp.com -lb /tmp/4k_Combo.txt -ch 10 -k "hunterio=ABCDE123"
```
###### Query username. Read keys from CLI

```bash
$ h8mail -t JSmith89 -q username -k "dehashed_email=user@email.com" "dehashed_key=ABCDE123"
```

###### Query IP. Chase all related targets. Read keys from CLI


```bash
$ h8mail -t 42.202.0.42 -q ip -c h8mail_config_priv.ini -ch 2 --power-chase
```

###### Fetch URL content (CLI + file). Target all found emails


```bash
$ h8mail -u "https://pastebin.com/raw/kQ6WNKqY" "list_of_urls.txt"
```
